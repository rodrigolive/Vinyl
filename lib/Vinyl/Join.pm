=head1 NAME

Vinyl::Join - simple class relationship resolver

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package Author;
    use Moose; with 'Vinyl::Document';
    has 'articles'  => ( is => 'rw', isa => 'Vinyl::Join[Article]' );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module can be used to parameterize relationships 
between two C<Vinyl::Document> classes. It should not
be used for C<Vinyl::EmbeddedDocument> classes.  

All object relationships are stored as reference C<$id> arrays
in the parent object, which translates into a performance hit
when loading the parent class, but not as much as loading all 
objects at one as when using an C<ArrayRef>. 

=head1 METHODS

=head2 add

Add (join) a Vinyl::Document object for later saving.

Saving the parent Vinyl::Document will save both. 

    my $author = Author->new;
    $author->articles->add( Article->new );
    $author->save; # saves all objects

=head2 remove

Delete from the relationship list.

    my $author = Author->find_one;
    my $first_article = $author->articles->find_one;
    $author->articles->remove( $first_article );

=head2 find

Run a C<find> on the joint collection.

    # searches for articles belonging to this collection
    my $cursor = $author->articles->find({ title=>'foo article' });
    while( my $article = $cursor->next ) {
        ...
    }

Returns a L<Vinyl::Cursor>. 

=head2 find_one

Just like find, but with a C<find_one> twist. 

=head2 all

Same as C<find>, but returns an ARRAY with all the results, instead 
of a cursor. 

=head2 query

Run a C<query> on the joint collection.

=head2 collection

Returns the set for the joint collection.

=head2 with_collection_name

Return the collection name for the joint Vinyl::Document.
